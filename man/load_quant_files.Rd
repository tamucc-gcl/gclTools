\usage{
load_quant_files(raw_data, plate_map)

load_quant_files(raw_data, plate_map)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{path to the raw plate reader data saved as a comma-separated value (csv) file. This is the file exported from the SpectraMax software. It contains the well and fluorescence information. This file should not be manipulated once it has been exported.}

\item{plate_map}{path to the assay plate map. This contains the information on how the samples were laid out in the 364-well plate and its associated metadata. This file follows a specific data structure. The following columns are expected:
\itemize{
\item plate_id: character string. Name of the sample plate/strip assayed. All standards used in the assay should be named "standard".
\item sample_id: character string. Name of the samples in the plate. This usually corresponds to well position. Standards used in this assay should be named based on the concentration (ng/ul) used.
\item replicate: numeric. The replicate used in the assay. A value of 2 is expected for "double-quants"
\item quant_row: character. Typically a letter indicating the row of the sample in the quant plate.
\item quant_column: numeric. Typically a number indicating the column of the sample in the quant plate.
\item sample_volume: numeric. Indicates the volume (uL) of samples and standards used in the assay.
}}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing two data frames: \code{sample} and \code{standard}

\description{
Prepare the raw data files for fluorescence analysis. This function reads the raw data and plate map, validates the file format and data structure, merges the files, and then prepares a list that separates the samples from the standards.

This is Step 1 of 4 in a series of functions for analyzing fluorescent data.
